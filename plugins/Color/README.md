The `Color` plugin contains

* the `Color` model (stored as rgba but with hsv, ... conversion methods)
* the `Gradient` model
* the `ModelEditor` plugins to view and edit the corresponding colors and gradients.

You can look the `test_ModelEditor` example (in the `tests` directory) to obtain an illustration.
